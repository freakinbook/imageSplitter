# imageSplitter
A quickly made app to split two-page scans into two one-page pictures.
This app was needed to simplify a task of copying and binding of a brochure. The pages were scanned continuously, two pages on a scan (1-2, 3-4 etc.). But to print and bind them, the pages needed to be reordered. Imagine a newspaper. First sheet of paper has the front page and the last page on one side and the second and the penultimate pages on the other side. And so on.
So this app divides a scan of two continuous pages into two separate images. And the reorder was did by hand. Maybe later I'll add this feature.
